# Ralphy Progress Log

## 2026-02-15: Phase 1 - Task 1: Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
- Scaffolded Vite + React + TypeScript project using `create-vite` with `react-ts` template
- Adapted project structure for Chrome Extension compatibility:
  - Created `src/background/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/types/` directories
  - Updated `index.html` as popup entry point (400x500px body dimensions)
  - Cleaned up boilerplate (removed default Vite/React demo code)
- Added Chrome Extension dev dependencies: `@types/chrome`
- Added test infrastructure: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jsdom`
- Configured Vitest in `vite.config.ts` with jsdom environment
- Added `chrome` type to `tsconfig.app.json` for Chrome API type support
- Updated `package.json` name to `pomodoro-task-extension`, added `test` and `test:watch` scripts
- Wrote 12 tests (App component rendering + project structure validation), all passing
- Linting passes cleanly

## 2026-02-15: Phase 1 - Task 2: Configure Tailwind CSS and install shadcn/ui CLI
- Installed Tailwind CSS v4 (`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`) as dev dependencies
- Configured `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in `vite.config.ts` for Tailwind v4 CSS-first approach
- Installed shadcn/ui core dependencies: `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`, `tw-animate-css`, `shadcn`
- Ran `npx shadcn@latest init --defaults` to scaffold shadcn/ui configuration:
  - Generated `components.json` with New York style, Vite framework, Tailwind v4
  - Updated `src/index.css` with `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@import "tw-animate-css"`, `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"`, full CSS variable theming (oklch colors), and `@theme inline` block
- Created `src/lib/utils.ts` with the `cn()` utility function (clsx + tailwind-merge)
- Added `@/*` path alias in `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `vite.config.ts` for shadcn imports
- Created missing source directories (`src/background/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/types/`) with `.gitkeep` files
- Wrote 12 new tests validating Tailwind + shadcn/ui configuration, all passing (24 total tests)
- Linting passes cleanly

## 2026-02-15: Phase 1 - Task 4: Create manifest.json (Manifest V3)
- Created `public/manifest.json` with Manifest V3 configuration:
  - `manifest_version: 3`
  - Permissions: `alarms`, `storage`, `notifications`, `activeTab`
  - Action: `default_popup` pointing to `index.html`, with `default_title`
  - Background: service worker with `type: "module"` for ES module support
  - Icons: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 PNG placeholder icons
- Created `public/icons/` directory with placeholder PNG icons (icon-16.png, icon-48.png, icon-128.png)
- Also marked Phase 1 - Task 3 (shadcn components) as complete in PRD (was already implemented in prior session)
- Wrote 20 new tests validating manifest.json structure, permissions, action, background, and icons (75 total tests)
- All 75 tests passing
- Linting passes cleanly (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings from shadcn components)

## 2026-02-15: Phase 2 - Task 1: Create src/background.ts with timer logic using chrome.alarms
- Created `src/background/index.ts` as the background service worker entry point
- Implemented core timer logic using `chrome.alarms` API:
  - `TimerStorageState` interface: duration, timeLeft, isRunning, startTime, mode (work/break)
  - `DEFAULT_TIMER_STATE`: 25-minute work timer, not running, null startTime
  - `getTimerState()`: reads timer state from `chrome.storage.local`, returns defaults if empty
  - `setTimerState()`: persists timer state to `chrome.storage.local`
  - `computeTimeLeft()`: calculates real-time remaining seconds using elapsed time from startTime
  - `startTimer()`: sets isRunning, records startTime, creates chrome alarm with correct delay and 1-minute period
  - `pauseTimer()`: computes remaining time, stops timer, clears chrome alarm
  - `resetTimer()`: resets timeLeft to duration (or custom duration), stops timer, clears alarm
  - `handleAlarm()`: on alarm fire, checks remaining time; finishes timer if zero, updates stored state if still running
- Registered `handleAlarm` as `chrome.alarms.onAlarm` listener at module level
- Wrote 47 tests covering:
  - Module structure (8 exports verified)
  - DEFAULT_TIMER_STATE values (5 tests)
  - getTimerState/setTimerState storage interaction (5 tests)
  - computeTimeLeft pure logic (4 tests: not running, null startTime, elapsed computation, floor at zero)
  - startTimer behavior (7 tests: sets running, records timestamp, creates alarm, saves state, idempotent, guards zero timeLeft, alarm delay)
  - pauseTimer behavior (5 tests: stops running, clears alarm, nulls startTime, preserves remaining time, no-op if not running)
  - resetTimer behavior (6 tests: stops running, resets timeLeft, clears alarm, nulls startTime, custom duration, default duration)
  - handleAlarm behavior (5 tests: ignores other alarms, no-op if not running, finishes at zero, clears alarm on finish, updates mid-run)
  - Listener registration (2 tests: addListener called, function passed)
- All 122 tests passing (47 new + 75 existing)
- Linting passes cleanly (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings from shadcn components)

## 2026-02-15: Phase 2 - Task 2: Implement chrome.storage.local to persist timer state
- Added `restoreTimerState()` function to `src/background/index.ts`:
  - Runs automatically on service worker startup to ensure persistence across Chrome service worker restarts
  - Reads persisted state from `chrome.storage.local` and checks if timer was running
  - If timer expired while service worker was inactive: marks timer as finished (isRunning=false, timeLeft=0), persists the finished state
  - If timer still has remaining time: recalculates `timeLeft` based on elapsed time since `startTime`, resets `startTime` to `Date.now()`, re-creates the chrome alarm with correct delay, persists the restored state
  - Preserves `mode` and `duration` during restoration
  - No-ops gracefully when timer is not running or `startTime` is null
- Called `restoreTimerState()` at module level after listener registration to ensure persistence on every service worker restart
- Wrote 14 new tests covering `restoreTimerState()`:
  - Export existence, default state return, not-running state passthrough, null startTime guard
  - Timer expired while inactive: finishes timer, persists finished state, does not create alarm
  - Timer still running: re-creates alarm, recalculates timeLeft, resets startTime, sets correct alarm delay, persists restored state
  - Preserves mode and duration during restore
- All 136 tests passing (14 new + 122 existing)
- Linting passes cleanly (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings from shadcn components)

## 2026-02-15: Phase 2 - Task 3: Setup chrome.notifications alert when countdown reaches zero
- Added `showTimerNotification()` function to `src/background/index.ts`:
  - Accepts `mode` parameter ('work' | 'break') to customize notification content
  - Work mode: title "Work session complete!", message "Great job! Time to take a break."
  - Break mode: title "Break is over!", message "Break finished. Ready to focus again?"
  - Uses `chrome.notifications.create()` with type 'basic', icon 'icons/icon-128.png', priority 2
  - Uses a consistent notification ID (`pomodoro-timer-finished`) to replace previous notifications
- Integrated notification into `handleAlarm()`: triggers `showTimerNotification(state.mode)` when timer reaches zero
- Integrated notification into `restoreTimerState()`: triggers notification when timer expired while service worker was inactive
- Added `NOTIFICATION_ID` constant for consistent notification identification
- Wrote 16 new tests covering:
  - showTimerNotification: export, chrome.notifications.create call, 'basic' type, icon URL, notification ID, work title, break title, work message, break message, priority 2
  - handleAlarm notification integration: triggers notification on finish, work-mode notification title, break-mode notification title, no notification when still running
  - restoreTimerState notification integration: triggers notification on expired timer, no notification when timer still running
- All 152 tests passing (16 new + 136 existing)
- Linting passes cleanly (0 errors, 2 pre-existing warnings from shadcn components)
