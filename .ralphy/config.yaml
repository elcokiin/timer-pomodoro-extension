# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
rules:
  - "Use Manifest V3 standards for all Chrome Extension APIs."
  - "All UI components must be built using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS."
  - "Timer logic must reside in a background service worker (background.ts) using chrome.alarms to ensure persistence when the popup is closed."
  - "Use chrome.storage.local to synchronize timer state and task list between the background script and the popup UI."
  - "Implement strict TypeScript interfaces for all data structures (TimerState, Task, Preset)."
  - "Use Lucide-React for icons and follow a clean, minimalist aesthetic."
  - "Ensure the 'Break' notification triggers both a browser notification and a shadcn Dialog/Toast."
