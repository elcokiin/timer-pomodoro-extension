Pomodoro Task Timer - Your Productivity Companion

Stay focused and get more done with Pomodoro Task Timer, a lightweight Chrome extension that combines the proven Pomodoro Technique with a built-in task manager.

--- HOW IT WORKS ---

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. Research shows this approach improves concentration, reduces mental fatigue, and helps you accomplish more in less time.

--- FEATURES ---

FOCUS TIMER
- Start, pause, and reset your work sessions with one click
- Watch your progress with a visual countdown and progress bar
- Automatic mode switching between work and break sessions
- Desktop notifications when your session ends

PRESET & CUSTOM DURATIONS
- Quick presets: 25 minutes (classic Pomodoro), 50 minutes (deep work), 15 minutes (short tasks)
- Custom duration input for any length session you need

TASK MANAGEMENT
- Add tasks directly in the extension
- Check off completed tasks as you go
- Select an active task to associate with your current focus session
- Delete tasks when they're no longer needed

PERSISTENT & RELIABLE
- Timer keeps running even when the popup is closed
- Tasks and timer state are saved across browser restarts
- No data loss, no sign-up required -- everything stays local

--- WHO IS THIS FOR? ---

- Students studying for exams
- Developers coding in focused sprints
- Writers working on articles, essays, or books
- Remote workers managing their daily workflow
- Anyone looking to build better focus habits
